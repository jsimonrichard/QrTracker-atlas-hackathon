# QrTracker

Welcome to QrTracker, a submission for the Atlas Hackathon put on by MongoDB and https://dev.to! QrTracker is a multi-purpose tracking alternative that gives small business owners (or anyone else, really) the ability to create, as well as consume, tracking information.

It's similar to the software that companies like FedEx and UPS use to give their customers tracking information, but it's open source.

QrTracker also allows for more freedom in how it's used; it supports, but does not require, geographical information.

## TODO

* Delete buttons are missing for trackers
* There's no way to revoke a collaborator's access
* There's no way to delete a tracker
* Search results could be better formatted
* The namesake of QrTracker: I'd like to create a QR code display for the share links
(and a way to print that QR code)
